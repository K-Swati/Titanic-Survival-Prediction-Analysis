# Overview
Welcome to my Titanic Survival Prediction Analysis! In this project, I delved into the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict passenger survival based on various features. This analysis is a result of applying machine learning techniques to gain insights into the factors influencing survival rates during that historical voyage.

# Project Highlights
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and gain initial insights.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, addressing missing values, and ensuring a structured dataset for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance the predictive power of the model, extracting meaningful information from existing variables.

Model Building: Utilized machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, to predict passenger survival.

# Python Libraries Used
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library for cleaning, exploring, and preprocessing the dataset.

NumPy: The fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, used for numerical operations and array manipulations.

Matplotlib: A versatile plotting library for creating insightful visualizations and graphs.

Seaborn: Built on Matplotlib, Seaborn enhances visualizations, making complex plots more accessible.

Scikit-learn: Employed for machine learning tasks, including model selection, training, and evaluation.

Jupyter Notebooks: Used for developing and presenting the analysis in an interactive and collaborative environment.

# Acknowledgement
I would like to express my gratitude to Kaggle for providing the Titanic dataset, and to the open-source community for their invaluable resources.
Feel free to explore the analysis, provide feedback, and let's keep the data discussions going!
